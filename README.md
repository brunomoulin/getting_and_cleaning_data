# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

Repo for this course's project.

## Files

`run_analysis.md` - The codebook for the work. Automatically generated and then manually updated from a copy of the namesake source code file. Describes variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data.

`v_names.txt` - Separate file with variable names only. Generated with: ``write.table(names(tidy), "names.txt", row.name=FALSE)``

`run_analysis.R` - Source code of the project.

`tidy.txt` - output, as requested in step 5, contains the tidy data set.
